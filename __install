# This file can be used to install applications across all environments managed by your dotman
# Dotman will automatically detect proper package manager and execute only 
# lines that start either with *, %, or with the name of detected package manager
# you can also substitute installed package manager name by using % symbol
# examples: 
# brew install neovim
# apt install neovim
# * echo "everywhere!"
# % install tig
